    "The key difference between Lasso regularization and Ridge regularization (L2 regularization) lies in the type of penalty applied to the coefficients. While Ridge regularization adds an L2 penalty term (sum of squared coefficients) to the loss function, Lasso regularization adds an L1 penalty term (sum of absolute coefficients). This difference has significant implications for the resulting models.\n",

    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Lasso regularization has a built-in feature selection mechanism. As the L1 penalty encourages sparsity, it tends to force some coefficients to exactly zero. This results in a model that automatically selects a subset of the most relevant features and discards the less important ones. It can be particularly useful when there are a large number of predictors, and identifying the most important ones is desirable.\n",

    "Sparse Solutions: Lasso regularization produces sparse solutions by pushing less important coefficients towards zero. This sparsity leads to simpler and more interpretable models, as well as potential computational advantages in cases where the number of predictors is large.\n",

In this case, the model can potentially capture the noise in the training data, resulting in high variance and overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "By introducing the L2 penalty term, Ridge regression constrains the coefficients, preventing them from taking excessively large values. The regularization parameter λ controls the trade-off between fitting the data and controlling the magnitude of the coefficients. A higher value of λ increases the penalty and leads to more shrinkage of the coefficients.\n",

If the relationship is non-linear, or if there are complex interactions between variables, linear models may not capture the underlying patterns effectively. In such cases, other non-linear regression techniques or more flexible models may be more suitable.\n",

When interpretability and explanation of the relationship between predictors and the response are of utmost importance, simpler linear models without regularization may be preferred.\n",

    "Feature Selection Bias: While regularization helps in feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero, it may also introduce a bias in the model. If important predictors are mistakenly assigned zero coefficients due to regularization, the model's predictive performance may be negatively impacted. In scenarios where all predictors are believed to have relevance, or when the exact identification of important predictors is critical, regularized models may not be the best choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Hyperparameters: Regularized linear models have hyperparameters, such as the regularization parameter (e.g., λ in Ridge regression), that need to be tuned. The optimal values of these hyperparameters may vary depending on the dataset and can be challenging to determine. Incorrect hyperparameter selection may result in suboptimal model performance. Careful cross-validation or other techniques for hyperparameter tuning are necessary to mitigate this limitation.\n",

    "Limited Capturing of Complex Relationships: Regularized linear models, by their nature, assume linear relationships and may struggle to capture complex and non-linear relationships between predictors and the response. If the relationship in the data is highly non-linear, more advanced non-linear regression techniques, such as decision trees, random forests, or neural networks, may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers and Robustness: Regularized linear models are sensitive to outliers. Outliers with large errors can disproportionately influence the regularization penalty and affect the model's coefficients. In situations where the presence of outliers is common or where robustness to outliers is crucial, alternative regression methods, such as robust regression or non-parametric models, may be more suitable."
