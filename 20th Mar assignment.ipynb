    "Data encoding is the process of converting data from one format or representation to another, often with the goal of making it suitable for storage, transmission, or processing in a specific context. Data encoding is commonly used in data science to transform data into a format that can be easily understood, analyzed, and processed by machine learning algorithms and other data analysis techniques.\n",
    "Data encoding is useful in data science for several reasons:\n",
    "1.Data representation: Data encoding allows for transforming data from one representation to another, such as converting text data into numerical or categorical representations that can be easily used in machine learning algorithms. For example, converting text data to numerical vectors using techniques like one-hot encoding, word embedding, or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) encoding can enable text data to be processed and analyzed by machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "2.Data normalization: Data encoding can be used to normalize data, which is the process of transforming data to have a consistent scale or range. Normalization is important for ensuring that different features or variables in the data are on a similar scale, which can help prevent certain features from dominating others during analysis or modeling. Common techniques for data normalization include min-max scaling, z-score normalization, and log transformation.\n",
    "3.Data privacy: Data encoding can be used for protecting sensitive data by transforming it into a format that does not reveal its original values. This can be important in cases where data privacy is a concern, such as when dealing with personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data. Techniques like data masking, tokenization, and encryption are commonly used for data privacy purposes.\n",
    "4.Data reduction: Data encoding can be used for reducing the dimensionality of data, which is the process of reducing the number of features or variables in a dataset. Dimensionality reduction can be useful in cases where data has a large number of features that can lead to computational inefficiency or overfitting in machine learning algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) are common techniques used for dimensionality reduction through data encoding."

In nominal encoding, each category or label is assigned a unique numerical value, allowing them to be represented as numbers in the data.\n",
    "One common example of nominal encoding is converting the \"gender\" variable into numerical values such as 0 for \"male\" and 1 for \"female\". Another example is encoding \"color\" categories into numerical values, such as 0 for \"red\", 1 for \"green\", and 2 for \"blue\"\n",
    "Real word scenario example will be - Building a Spam Detection Model - We can use nominal encoding to assign the value 0 to \"ham\" and 1 to \"spam\". This would convert the categorical \"label\" feature into numerical values, which can be easily processed by machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes."

    "Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, may be preferred over one-hot encoding in certain situations where the categorical variable has a large number of unique categories or when dealing with algorithms or models that require numerical inputs. Here's a practical example:\n",
    "Scenario: Building a Text Classification Model\n",
    "Suppose you are working on a project to build a text classification model for sentiment analysis, where you need to classify customer reviews into three categories: \"positive\", \"neutral\", and \"negative\". The dataset contains a large number of reviews, and the \"sentiment\" feature has three categories as mentioned.\n",

    "One of the advantages of nominal encoding in this scenario is that it reduces the dimensionality of the feature from three binary columns (using one-hot encoding) to a single numerical column, which may be more efficient in terms of memory and computation."

    "One-Hot Encoding: One-hot encoding can be used for the categorical features such as \"habitat\" and \"diet\" which are likely to have multiple distinct categories with no inherent ordinal relationship among them. For example, \"habitat\" may have categories such as \"forest\", \"desert\", and \"ocean\", and \"diet\" may have categories such as \"herbivore\", \"carnivore\", and \"omnivore\". One-hot encoding would create binary columns for each category, representing whether a particular category is present or not for a given animal record. This would allow the machine learning algorithm to capture the categorical information without imposing any arbitrary numerical order or bias.\n",
    "Label Encoding: Label encoding can be used for the categorical feature \"species\" if it has an inherent ordinal relationship among the categories. For example, if \"species\" has categories such as \"mammal\", \"bird\", and \"reptile\", where there is a meaningful ordinal relationship among the categories (i.e., mammals > birds > reptiles), label encoding can be applied to assign numerical labels based on this ordinal relationship. This would allow the machine learning algorithm to capture the ordinal information while preserving the inherent order among the categories.\n",

    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: I would use label encoding for the categorical feature \"gender\" which has two distinct categories, typically represented as binary values. For example, if \"gender\" has categories \"male\" and \"female\", I would assign numerical labels, such as 0 for \"male\" and 1 for \"female\", using a label encoding technique. Label encoding can be easily implemented using libraries such as scikit-learn in Python.\n",

    "Standard Numerical Encoding: For the categorical feature \"contract type\", I would use standard numerical encoding. \"Contract type\" likely has multiple categories such as \"month-to-month\", \"one-year\", and \"two-year\". I would assign numerical values to these categories based on their occurrence or frequency in the dataset. For example, \"month-to-month\" could be assigned a value of 0, \"one-year\" could be assigned a value of 1, and \"two-year\" could be assigned a value of 2. This encoding can be easily implemented using pandas or other data manipulation libraries in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Encoding: Since \"age\", \"monthly charges\", and \"tenure\" are already numerical features, they do not require any encoding as they are already in a numerical format.\n",
