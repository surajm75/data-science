    "A database is a collection of structured data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and management of data. Databases can be used for a wide range of applications, from storing and managing customer information to tracking inventory to powering complex web applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems (DBMS) that differ in their structure, design philosophy, and data model. Here are some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Model: SQL databases follow a rigid, structured data model, where data is organized into tables with pre-defined relationships between them. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, have a more flexible data model, where data is stored in a variety of ways, such as key-value pairs, document-oriented, or graph-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query Language: As the name suggests, SQL databases use SQL as the primary language for querying and manipulating data. SQL is a standardized language that is used across most relational databases, which makes it easy for developers and analysts to switch between different database systems. NoSQL databases, however, do not use SQL as a primary query language. Instead, they often have their own proprietary query languages or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that they can only handle increased traffic and data by adding more resources (CPU, RAM, storage) to a single machine. NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable, which means that they can handle increased traffic and data by adding more machines to a distributed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Consistency: SQL databases are known for their strong data consistency guarantees, which means that data is always in a consistent state, even if multiple users are accessing it at the same time. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency, which can result in eventual consistency or even data loss in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are often a good choice for applications that require a rigid, structured data model, and strong data consistency guarantees. NoSQL databases are often a good choice for applications that require a more flexible data model, scalability, and eventual consistency. However, the choice between SQL and NoSQL ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the application and the data being stored."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language, and it is a set of SQL commands used to define the structure and organization of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some examples of DDL commands and their uses:\n",
    "CREATE: The CREATE command is used to create new database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table called \"customers\" with columns for name, address, and phone number:\n",

    "DROP: The DROP command is used to delete existing database objects, such as tables, indexes, and views. For example, the following SQL statement drops the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "ALTER: The ALTER command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as a table. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column called \"email\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers\n",
    "ADD email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE command is used to delete all data from a table, while keeping the table structure intact. For example, the following SQL statement deletes all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n",

A primary key cannot have duplicate values, and it must have a value for each row in the table. A primary key is typically used as the primary means of identifying and retrieving data from a table. For example, in a table of customers, the primary key might be the customer ID, which is unique to each customer.\n",

    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. A foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, and it is used to ensure data consistency and integrity between the tables. For example, in a table of orders, the foreign key might be the customer ID, which refers to the primary key in the customers table. This ensures that each order is associated with a valid customer in the customers table.\n",
