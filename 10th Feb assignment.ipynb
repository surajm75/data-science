    "The close() function is used to explicitly close a file that has been opened using the open() function. It is important to close a file after you have finished working with it for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Management: When a file is opened, system resources, such as file descriptors, are allocated to it. These resources are limited, and if too many files are opened without closing them, it can lead to resource exhaustion. By closing the file, you release these system resources, allowing them to be used by other parts of your program or other programs running on the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity: When you write data to a file, it is often buffered in memory before being written to the underlying storage. Closing a file ensures that any remaining buffered data is flushed and written to the file before it is closed. If you don't close the file and the program terminates unexpectedly, the buffered data may not be written, leading to potential data loss or corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "File Locking: In some cases, when a file is opened, it may be locked by the operating system to prevent other processes from accessing or modifying it. Closing the file releases the lock, allowing other processes to access the file if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portability: While most operating systems automatically close open files when a program exits, it is considered good practice to explicitly close files to ensure portability across different platforms and to make the code more robust and reliable."

    "Automatic Resource Management: When you open a file using the open() function without the with statement, you need to explicitly call the close() method to close the file and release system resources.

However, with the with statement, the file is automatically closed when the block of code is exited, even if an exception occurs. This ensures proper resource management without the need for manual cleanup.\n",

    "Exception Safety: When working with files, there is a possibility of exceptions occurring, such as file not found errors or permission issues. If an exception is raised before the close() method is called, the file may remain open and resources may not be released properly. By using the with statement, the file is automatically closed, even in the presence of exceptions, ensuring that resources are properly released and the file is not left in an inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Readability and Conciseness: The with statement improves the readability and conciseness of the code. It clearly delineates the block of code that operates within the context of the file, making it easier to understand the code's intention. The with statement eliminates the need for explicitly calling the close() method, reducing the clutter and making the code more concise and readable."
