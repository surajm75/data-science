    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception is raised, the program stops executing its normal flow and jumps to a block of code known as an exception handler, which can handle the exception and allow the program to continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, occur when there is a problem with the structure of the program's code. This type of error is detected by the Python interpreter when it tries to parse and execute the code. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur during the parsing and compilation of the code, while exceptions occur during the execution of the code. Syntax errors are typically caused by typos, missing or extra brackets, or other issues that cause the code to be invalid syntax. Exceptions, on the other hand, can be caused by a variety of reasons, such as unexpected input data, resource unavailability, or logical errors in the code."
