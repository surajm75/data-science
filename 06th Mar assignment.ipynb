    "Measures of central tendency and variability are commonly used in statistics to describe and summarize the main features or characteristics of a dataset. These measures provide insights into the typical or central value of the data, as well as the variability or spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of central tendency:\n",
    "a. Mean: The mean, or average, is calculated by summing all the values in a dataset and dividing by the number of values. It represents the \"typical\" value of a dataset and is affected by all the values in the dataset. The mean is commonly used to describe the central tendency of a dataset when the data are approximately normally distributed and do not have extreme outliers.\n",
    "b. Median: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. It is not affected by extreme values and is useful when the data have outliers or are not normally distributed. The median is commonly used to describe the central tendency of a dataset when the data are skewed or have extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Mode: The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a dataset. It represents the most common value in the dataset and is useful for describing the most prevalent category or value in a dataset. The mode is commonly used to describe the central tendency of categorical or discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of variability:\n",
    "a. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset. It provides a simple measure of the spread or variability of data, but it is sensitive to extreme values and may not accurately represent the overall variability of the dataset.\n",
    "b. Variance: Variance is a measure of how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean. It is calculated as the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. Variance provides a measure of the overall variability of the dataset, but it is in squared units and may be influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "c. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and is also a measure of how much the values in a dataset deviate from the mean. It is commonly used to describe the variability of a dataset and is often preferred over variance because it is in the same units as the original data and is easier to interpret. The standard deviation is widely used in statistics and data analysis to quantify the spread or dispersion of data."
